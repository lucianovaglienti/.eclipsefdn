Proposed updates so far:

dependabot_alerts_enabled: false, --   we should use renovate instead

has_discussions: true, -- don’t see any sense in having this off. TODO:look into the api for github discussions to limit

actions_can_approve_pull_request_reviews: false – actions should not be able to merge into main by default

require_conversation_resolution: true – We want to people to close their review comments before merging.

Add branch settings to allow non-main, non-release branches(if we have any) to be deleted. Still TODO we need to investigate what branches if(any) that we will have for releases.

We will have to update status checks as they are made to block merge. (Note: status checks that don’t always run need a corollary always passing job).

code_scanning_default_setup_enabled: true if it doesn't have too many errors the first time

Limit bots making spam PRs – at some point

TENTATIVE(future meeting):

requires_code_owner_reviews : true – This will help protect our codebase as areas where we have PoCs can be guaranteed to be reviewed by someone who knows the area.
